      <h2>My coding journey</h2>
      <p>Thanks for stopping by. Please have a look around. I am happy to share wtih you my past
        and current projects and studies. In the blog section I document my experiences in programming 
        and show the training courses I took. You may also look at my web projects 
        that I have accomplished during my studies. Check my contact page and
        write me an email or get in touch via Twitter.</p>
      <h2>A little bit about myself</h2>
      <p>I am from Kyrgyzstan - a beautiful mountainous country in Central Asia. Since 2012, I have been living in
        Ukraine. Due to the war, I moved with my family to Switzerland where I studied at the University of Bern in 2003. 
        In March 2023 I started self-learning of programming in HTML, CSS and JavaScript (JS) and look forward to
        continuing this interesting coding journey as my next professional endeavor. On the personal front, 
        I am a father of two boys. I like cooking on fire, playing football and hiking in the
        mountains. Be my guest and get in touch!</p>
      <p>Sincerely yours, Vladimir :-)</p>
