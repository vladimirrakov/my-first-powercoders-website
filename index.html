        <h2>Hello World!</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Vladimir. I live in Bern, Switzerland and learn programming
          as a participant of
          <a href="https://powercoders.org/programs/bootcamp/" target="_blank"
            >Powercoders Bootcamp</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks for stopping by. Have a look around. I am happy to share with
          you my past and current projects and studies. In the
          <a href="/blog/index.html">blog</a> section I document my experiences
          in programming and show the training courses I took. You may also look
          at the web <a href="/projects/index.html">projects</a> I have
          accomplished during my studies.
        </p>
        <p>
          My current IT interests lie in front-end development and project
          management. I am interested in cloud and cyber security solutions. It
          makes me fascinated to study digital universes such as Salesforce,
          Microsoft, AWS and Google.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work in German, English, Russian and Ukrainian. My strong sides are
          communication and marketing in digital trade of goods and services. I
          think one should never stop learning and sharing knowledge with
          others. This helps to overcome any challenges and find like minded
          people in whatever situation you may unpredictably find yourself.
        </p>
        <h2>My coding journey</h2>
        <p>
          Due to the war in Ukraine, I moved with my family to Switzerland where
          I studied at the University of Bern in 2003. In March 2023 I started
          self-learning of programming with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (JS) and
          look forward to continuing this interesting coding journey as my next
          professional endeavor.
        </p>
        <p>Now, I like to remember, that</p>
        <div class="quote_block">
          <p class="quote">
            Einstein was also a refugee. <br />
            And a bundle of belongings isnâ€™t the only thing a refugee brings to
            his new country.

        <h2>A little bit about myself</h2>
        <p>
          I am originally from Kyrgyzstan - a beautiful mountainous country in
          Central Asia. I am a father of two boys and like cooking on fire,
          playing football and hiking in the mountains. Please, find more about
          me
