      <h2>Hello World!</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Vladimir. I live in Bern, Switzerland and learn programming
        as a participant of
        <a href="https://powercoders.org/programs/bootcamp/" target="_blank">Powercoders Bootcamp</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks for stopping by. Have a look around. I am very happy to share with
        you my past and current projects and studies. In the
        <a href="/blog/index.html">blog</a> section I document my experiences
        in programming and show the training courses I took. You may also look
        at the web <a href="/projects/index.html">projects</a> I have
        accomplished during my studies.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current IT interests lie in front-end development and project
        management. I am interested in cloud and cyber security solutions. It
        makes me fascinated to study digital universes such as Salesforce,
        Microsoft, AWS and Google.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work in German, English, Russian and Ukrainian. My strong sides are
        communication and marketing in digital trade of goods and services. I
        think one should never stop learning and sharing knowledge with
        others. This helps to overcome any challenges and find like minded
        people in whatever situation you may unpredictably find yourself.
      </p>
      <h2>My coding journey</h2>
      <p>
        Due to the war in Ukraine, I moved with my family to Switzerland where
        I studied at the University of Bern in 2003. In March 2023 I started
        self-learning of programming with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (JS) and
        look forward to continuing this interesting coding journey as my next
        professional endeavor.
      </p>
      <p>Now, I like to remember, that</p>
      <div class="quote_block">
        <p class="quote">
          Einstein was also a refugee. And a bundle of belongings isn’t the only thing a refugee brings to
          his new country.

      <h2>A little bit about myself</h2>
      <p>
        I am originally from Kyrgyzstan - a beautiful mountainous country in
        Central Asia. I am a father of two boys and like cooking on fire,
        playing football and hiking in the mountains. Please, find more about
        me
        <a href="/about/index.html">here</a> and
        <a href="/contact/index.html">get in touch</a>!
      </p>
      <p>Sincerely yours, Vladimir 🙂</p>
